# Thesis Code

Here is presented the full code that I wrote for my master's thesis "Statistical physics applications in complex systems: Applications of timeseries and correlation methods at innovation network (patents)". <br />
The order of the files is as follows:

1)filter_cited_patents.py <br />
2)fuzzy_search.py <br />
3)citation_sums.py <br />
