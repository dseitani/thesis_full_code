### Abstract  

The aim of this paper is to study the European citation and patent network, in order to
highlight the companies with the greatest in
uence in the field of innovation, as well as
any correlations between their citations and patents. Initially, citation and patent data,
provided by the OECD, were analyzed and time series for the top 100 most-referenced
companies in Europe were created. From these time series it was found which of the 100
companies have the largest variance, and consequently the highest volatility, and the time
correlation between citations and patents. From the above analysis it is concluded that
there is a significant correlation, for most companies, between their citations and patents
and a lag in the time series of citations in relation to the time series of patents for a
short period of time, not exceeding 2 to 3 years. There is also a significant percentage
of the companies that does not have a lag, which leads to the conclusion that there are
many self-citations. Finally, a small study was conducted on the possible correlation of
the stock price of companies with their citations and patents, but no significant results
were found.
